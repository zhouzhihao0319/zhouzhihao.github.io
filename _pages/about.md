My name is Zhihao Zhou(周致毫), a Data Scientist working at [DSV Air&Sea](https://www.dsv.com/en-us/)(Los Angeles). My work includes setting up matrix, SQL, a/b testing. Before that, i obtained my M.S. degree at Department of Biostatistics, University of Southern California, and i received my B.S. degree (Mathematics) from China Agricultural University. 

During my time at USC I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lu Zhang](https://luzhangstat.github.io) of [Division of Biostatistics](https://keck.usc.edu/biostatistics/) from [Keck School of Medicine](https://keck.usc.edu), [University of Southern California(USC)](https://www.usc.edu).
