excerpt: 'This thesis conducts a thorough simulation study to assess the effectiveness of vari-
ous acceleration techniques designed to enhance the conjugate gradient algorithm,
which is used for solving large linear systems to accelerate Bayesian computation
in spatial analysis. The focus is on the application of symbolic decomposition
and preconditioners, which are essential for the computational efficiency of conju-
gate gradient. The findings reveal notable differences in the effectiveness of these
acceleration methods. Specific preconditioners, such as the Diagonal Precondi-
tioner, consistently delivered improvements in computational speed. However, in
settings involving high-dimensional matrices, traditional solvers were less effec-
tive, underscoring the importance of specialized acceleration techniques like the
diagonal preconditioner and cgsparse. These methods demonstrated robust perfor-
mance across a variety of scenarios. The results of this study not only enhance our
understanding of the algorithmic dynamics within spatial statistics but also offer
valuable guidance for practitioners in choosing the most appropriate computational
techniques for their specific needs.

This thesis conducts a thorough simulation study to assess the effectiveness of vari- ous acceleration techniques designed to enhance the conjugate gradient algorithm, which is used for solving large linear systems to accelerate Bayesian computation in spatial analysis. The focus is on the application of symbolic decomposition and preconditioners, which are essential for the computational efficiency of conju- gate gradient. The findings reveal notable differences in the effectiveness of these acceleration methods. Specific preconditioners, such as the Diagonal Precondi- tioner, consistently delivered improvements in computational speed.
